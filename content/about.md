Chicago Beach Day is a website to check the weather and water quality of Chicago beaches to help you decide if today's a good day to go to the beach in Chicago!

A few years ago I realized that Lake Michigan stays warm well into September. As a lifelong Chicagoan, I had never gone to the beach in September. I decided to go to the beach in September and I had a great time. I thought to myself, "I should do this more often." I created this website to help me and others decide if today's a good day to go to the beach in Chicago.
